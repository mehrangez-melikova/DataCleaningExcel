<h1>Data Cleaning in Excel</h1>


 
 </h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
This repository contains the data cleaning and initial analysis of the [sales_data_original.xlsx - Data.csv] dataset. The primary goal of this project is to transform raw, inconsistent data into a clean, structured, and reliable format suitable for robust business analysis and reporting.

<h2>Objective:</h2> Identify and document data quality issues within the provided dataset to prepare it for accurate analysis.

<h2>The data cleaning process focused on identifying and rectifying the following key data quality issues:</h2>

- <b>Missing Values: Addressed numerous blank cells across critical columns (OrderDate, Region, Rep, Item, Units, Unit Cost, Total) to ensure data completeness and prevent analytical inaccuracies.

- <b>Inconsistent Data Types: Converted numerical columns (Units, Unit Cost, Total) from text to a proper numerical format, enabling accurate mathematical operations and aggregations.

- <b>Potential Duplicates: Implemented strategies to identify and handle potential duplicate records, ensuring each entry represents a unique transaction.

- <b>Text Field Consistency: Standardized text entries in categorical columns (Region, Rep) by addressing inconsistent capitalization and removing leading/trailing spaces. This ensures accurate grouping and filtering for analysis.

- <b>Date Format Consistency: Verified and standardized the OrderDate format to ensure proper chronological sorting and date-based calculations.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
Microsoft Excel: Utilized Excel's built-in functionalities (e.g., Text to Columns, Remove Duplicates, TRIM, PROPER functions, data type formatting) for efficient data cleaning.
